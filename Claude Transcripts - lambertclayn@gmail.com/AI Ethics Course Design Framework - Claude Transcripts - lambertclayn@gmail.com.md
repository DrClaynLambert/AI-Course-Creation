This document outlines the design of an AI Concierge Support system for an ethics course that uses an "archaeological excavation" metaphor for students to explore their own ethical reasoning across different philosophical frameworks.\
The key innovation here is creating a differentiated support structure:\
Well-Supported "Core Archaeological Sites" (6 frameworks):

- Utilitarianism, Virtue Ethics, Deontology, Natural Law, Social Contracts, Feminism/Ethics of Care
- Include robust AI diagnostic scaffolding and resource direction
- Backed by quality Open Educational Resources

Independent "Advanced Excavation Sites" (4 frameworks):

- Marxism, Postmodernism, Environmental Ethics, Bioethics
- Require more self-directed exploration with minimal AI support
- Framed as opportunities for advanced/independent work

The AI functions as an "Academic Concierge" - diagnosing student needs and directing them to instructor-curated resources rather than providing direct content instruction. This preserves the instructor's authority while preventing students from immediately seeking help when they encounter difficulties.\
The current discussion focuses on drafting specific language for framework introductions that will:

1. Set clear expectations about support levels
1. Embed scaffolding cues in AI prompts
1. Guide students on when to use AI vs. instructor consultation

This appears to be a thoughtful approach to managing pedagogical ambitions within practical constraints while maintaining academic rigor. Would you like me to help develop any specific aspects of this framework or analyze particular elements of the design?\
Retry\
**C**\
The last elements were the end of a previous conversation identifying places in the overall class that need to be adjusted to support this new concept of anticipatory scaffolding. The first element I need to work on is the two elements of Part 4 in the AI Prompts - first, an overall new instruction for students that lets them know about the anticipatory scaffolding and encouraging them to work through that process before seeking out external support, including instructor communication.\
Edit\
Looking at the document, I can see you need to create two components for Part 4 of the AI Prompts:

1. Overall instruction for students about the anticipatory scaffolding system
1. Framework-specific embedded elements that activate the scaffolding within the prompts

Let me draft the overall student instruction first:\

Part 2 Ethical Heuristics\
Part 2: Discovering Your Ethical Heuristics\
In Part 1, you identified your ethical dilemma and the roles that create competing obligations. Now you need to uncover the decision-making patterns that actually guide your behavior in each role—not what you think should guide you, but what actually does.\
You'll work with AI as an interviewer to discover these patterns through guided conversation.\
AI Heuristics Discovery Prompt\
*Copy everything in this box and paste it into your AI conversation:*\
You're going to interview me to discover the ethical heuristics—the actual decision-making patterns, principles, and "if/then" rules—that guide my behavior in different roles. I've already identified a complex ethical dilemma involving multiple competing roles.\
Your job as interviewer is to help me uncover what I actually do when making ethical decisions, not what I think I should do. Be genuinely curious, ask follow-up questions, and help me be honest about uncomfortable patterns.\
First, ask me to share my Part 1 findings so you understand my dilemma and roles.\
Then help me discover, for each role I identified:\
\- 2-3 core principles that actually drive my decisions in that role\
\- 2-3 character traits I try to embody in that role\
\- 3-5 "if/then" decision rules I actually use\
Interview techniques to use:\
\- Ask scenario-based questions: "Walk me through your thinking when..."\
\- Probe for contradictions between roles: "Earlier you said X, but now you're prioritizing Y..."\
\- Distinguish behavior from aspirations: "What do you actually do vs. what you think you should do?"\
\- Extract if/then patterns: "When X happens, you typically...?"\
\- Surface cross-role tensions: "How do you decide which role wins when they conflict?"\
Don't judge my patterns or solve my dilemma. Just help me articulate how I actually make decisions. Push gently when I stay too abstract or aspirational.\
At the end, organize what we've discovered into a structured summary by role, including any cross-role patterns you notice.\
Start by asking for my Part 1 findings, then begin the discovery interview.\
Process Notes\
*This process can feel uncomfortable. You might discover gaps between your ideals and your actual behavior, or recognize patterns you're not proud of. This discomfort often means the process is working—you're uncovering authentic decision-making rather than staying in wishful thinking mode.*\
Be honest about what you actually do. *The AI isn't judging your patterns. The goal is understanding your current ethical "operating system" so you can thoughtfully examine it against formal frameworks later.*\
Set aside uninterrupted time. *The interview might take 45-60 minutes. Be prepared for genuine self-examination.*\
Expect 25-35 specific heuristics. *You'll end up with heuristics across all your roles. This gives you enough material for meaningful semester-long analysis without being overwhelming.*\
Save everything. *Save both the complete conversation and the final structured summary. You'll use these heuristics as your baseline for comparing with formal ethical frameworks throughout the semester.*\
The patterns you discover become your personalized starting point for exploring utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, care ethics, and other approaches. Understanding how you actually think about ethics now is essential for meaningful philosophical exploration later.\

Final Archaeological Challenge You've completed your archaeological exploration of ethical reasoning, uncovering the philosophical frameworks that already exist in your thinking through 9 excavation reports. But every archaeological site has unexplored territory—areas that remain unexcavated, artif\
pasted\
**C**\
Ok. This is the "deep dive" assignment, to be completed after they work their way through the ethical models. The new design significantly disrupts this approach, and might even beg the question of whether it is even needed. Thoughts?\
Edit\
Looking at this assignment in light of your new differentiated framework structure, I see several tensions:\
The core pedagogical value remains strong - asking students to identify what's missing, avoided, or unexplained in their philosophical landscape is powerful self-reflective work that can deepen their understanding significantly.\
But the assumptions have shifted fundamentally:

1. The "complete exploration" premise is no longer accurate - students working only with structured frameworks won't have done 9 excavation reports across all frameworks, so the "you've explored everything, now what's missing?" framing doesn't match their actual experience.
1. The optional/required distinction changes the investigation focus - students who chose not to engage with independent exploration frameworks might naturally gravitate toward those as their "unexplored territory," which could work well or could feel like you're just pushing them toward the optional content.
1. The troubleshooting-supported vs. independent dynamic creates different preparation levels - students will have had much deeper, more supported engagement with structured frameworks, potentially making their reflection more sophisticated about those areas.

Potential revisions could:

- Reframe this as "archaeological horizons" - what lies beyond your current excavation site?
- Focus on synthesis and integration of what they *have* explored rather than what they haven't
- Emphasize the creative/applied formats more heavily since they now have solid foundation in 6 frameworks
- Position this as "applied philosophy" where they use their excavated understanding to tackle new problems

What's your sense of whether the deep dive serves a pedagogical purpose that isn't already being met by the structured framework work with troubleshooting support?\
Retry\
**C**\
The original purpose of the deep dive was to encourage them to explore something that either was missing after their excavation of their dilemma and heuristics. But now I see that the real problem is that this activity never closed the loop on the original premise of the course - identify a dilemma, label heuristics, identify conflicts, classify the presence of ethical models in the heuristics, then...explore one of them more? Why did I spend all this time focusing on tension and conflict, then just drop it? Nope, the final phase needs to engage in some kind of action plan. Do you see options for resolution? Are there models that might fill in some of these gaps? Are there some that you think would only make things more complex? What does your excavation suggest should be your next steps?\
Edit\
You're absolutely right - there's a major pedagogical gap here! The course builds beautifully toward understanding ethical complexity through the conflict mapping, then just... wanders off into academic exploration instead of helping students actually work with that complexity.\
The natural culmination should be: "Now that you understand the anatomy of your ethical tensions, what are you going to do about them?"\
A resolution-focused final assignment could ask:\
Step 1: Conflict Analysis Review

- Which conflicts from your map proved most significant as you explored frameworks?
- Did any frameworks offer tools for resolving specific tensions?
- Where did frameworks clarify vs. complicate your conflicts?

Step 2: Strategic Assessment

- Are there resolutions available that you hadn't considered?
- Which conflicts might be permanently unresolvable (and how do you live with that)?
- What frameworks offer the most practical guidance for your actual dilemma?

Step 3: Action Planning

- Given what you've learned, how will you approach your dilemma differently?
- What decision-making tools or principles will you adopt, modify, or reject?
- How will you handle future situations involving these same tensions?

Step 4: Implementation Reflection

- What would "success" look like in managing these ethical tensions?
- How will you know if your new approach is working?
- What support systems or accountability measures do you need?

This keeps the archaeological metaphor (you've excavated the site, now what do you do with what you found?) while actually completing the learning cycle. Students end with practical wisdom about their own ethical decision-making rather than just academic knowledge about frameworks.\
Does this direction feel more aligned with your course's foundational purpose?\
Retry\
**C**\
I think it works better with the state of the course as it now stands...\
Edit\
Exactly! The new structure creates a much more coherent learning arc:

1. Identify your dilemma (the ethical problem you're actually facing)
1. Discover your heuristics (how you actually make decisions)
1. Map your conflicts (where your patterns create tensions)
1. Explore frameworks systematically (tools for understanding these tensions)
1. Develop an action plan (how to move forward with what you've learned)

This makes the whole "archaeological excavation" metaphor work properly - you don't just dig up artifacts and catalog them, you use what you've discovered to inform how you'll live going forward.\
The troubleshooting support in the structured frameworks becomes more meaningful too, because students know they're building toward practical application, not just academic understanding. Every framework exploration has stakes: "Does this help me work with my actual conflicts, or not?"\
And it validates the time spent on conflict mapping - that becomes the crucial bridge between self-understanding and philosophical exploration, rather than just another step in a sequence.\
Would you like me to draft a revised version of the final assignment that focuses on this resolution/action planning approach? It could maintain the open-ended, student-directed qualities you valued in the original while actually closing the loop on the course's central promise.\
Retry\
**C**\
No, that's the other thing. Again, the prompt is written facing the student, when it needs to be solely oriented to helping the AI understand its role in facilitating student learning through this process.\
Edit\
Ah yes! The same issue as with the earlier prompts - this needs to be entirely AI-facing instructions for guiding students through their resolution/action planning process, not a mix of student directions and AI guidance.\
The AI needs clear instructions on how to:

- Help students review and synthesize their conflict mapping and framework exploration
- Guide them through strategic assessment of their options
- Support them in developing practical action plans
- Facilitate reflection on implementation and accountability

Rather than telling students "Step 1: Do X, Step 2: Do Y," the prompt should tell the AI "Guide the student to examine X by asking these types of questions, then help them move toward Y through this approach..."\
This maintains the personalized, conversational discovery process you've established throughout the course, where the AI serves as a philosophical coach helping students work through their own reasoning rather than following predetermined steps.\
Should I work on drafting an AI-facing prompt for this resolution/action planning process?\
Retry\
**C**\
Going back a couple of steps, you listed different elements of the final project. Rather than shaping this as a everyone does all of these, I was wondering if it would get too "crazy" if students got to decide which of these steps, or a combination of them, would be most meaningful to them. Some might want to go as far as making action steps. Others might be realizing that their perceived vs actual foundations were significantly different and might need time to process those implications. Both approaches could be meaningful in terms of demonstrating the core learning outcomes, but in very different ways.\
Edit\
That's a brilliant insight! You're right - different students will be at very different places after their framework exploration, and forcing everyone through the same resolution process could actually undermine the personalized learning you've built throughout the course.\
The beauty of offering options:\
Strategic Resolution - For students ready to move toward action planning and practical next steps\
Foundational Reconsideration - For students who discovered significant gaps between their perceived and actual ethical foundations and need to process those implications\
Integration Exploration - For students who want to synthesize what they've learned across frameworks\
Complexity Acceptance - For students who've realized their tensions may be unresolvable and want to explore how to live with that\
This actually honors the archaeological metaphor better - different excavations yield different types of discoveries, and what you do with those discoveries depends on what you found. Some sites reveal clear answers, others reveal how much you didn't know you didn't know.\
It also maintains the course's respect for student agency while ensuring everyone demonstrates the learning outcomes through genuine philosophical engagement rather than going through prescribed motions.\
An AI prompt could help students identify which direction feels most meaningful to them based on their actual excavation experience, then guide them through their chosen approach. The AI becomes a philosophical counselor helping them discern what kind of processing they actually need.\
Does this feel like it preserves the learning integrity while honoring different student readiness levels?\

Retry\
**C**\
OK. We'll get back to the prompt in a moment, but the actual final project isn't their path forward, it is the self-assessment of their learning choices and experience over the semester. Remember, they aren't graded on the production of any of these elements, but on the clarity and justification of the choices they made and why, along with evidence collected from their learning materials to support those interpretations.\
Edit\
Ah, you're absolutely right! I misunderstood the assignment structure. The final project isn't the resolution work itself - it's their reflective self-assessment of their learning journey and the choices they made throughout the semester.\
So the AI prompt I drafted would guide them through the resolution/processing work as their final learning activity, but then the actual final project would be their self-assessment where they:

- Reflect on and justify the learning choices they made throughout the semester
- Analyze their engagement with different parts of the course
- Use evidence from their dilemma work, heuristics discovery, conflict mapping, and framework explorations to support their interpretations
- Demonstrate their understanding of their own learning process and growth

The AI would need a different prompt for helping them with this self-assessment - guiding them to:

- Review their collected learning materials as evidence
- Articulate and justify their choices (which frameworks to explore deeply, which conflicts to focus on, what resolution approach to take)
- Connect their choices to their learning outcomes
- Reflect critically on their own engagement and development

This makes much more sense with your competency-based assessment approach. The learning is in the doing, but the assessment is in the thoughtful reflection on and justification of what they chose to do and why.\
Should I revise the prompt to focus on this self-assessment guidance instead?\
