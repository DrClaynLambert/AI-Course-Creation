This open access textbook is likely one of the sources you were thinking of that addresses Nietzsche's ethical philosophy. The book covers key ideas in normative ethics, metaethics, and applied ethics, and would likely include discussion of Nietzsche's moral philosophy.\

What about Brusseau? Are you looking at the Google doc I added that contains Tables of Contents?\
Edit\
You're absolutely right! I should look more carefully at the Google Doc you provided. Let me check it again for Brusseau and other sources that might address Nietzsche.\
Looking back at the Google Doc content, I can see it contains tables of contents from various ethics textbooks, but I don't immediately see Brusseau listed in the content I fetched. Let me search for Brusseau's ethics textbook to see if it contains Nietzsche content:\

Perfect! I can see that James Brusseau is indeed the author of "The Business Ethics Workshop" and he is author of "Decadence of the French Nietzsche" [Friedrich Nietzsche (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/)\
, which shows his expertise in Nietzschean philosophy. Let me fetch the Saylor.org PDF to see if it contains Nietzsche content:\

You're absolutely right! I've now included James Brusseau's "The Business Ethics Workshop" in the Nietzschean ethics bibliography. Given that Brusseau has written extensively on Nietzsche (including "Decadence of the French Nietzsche"), his business ethics textbook likely contains relevant Nietzschean ethical perspectives. Thank you for pointing me back to the sources you provided - I should have been more thorough in examining all the materials in your Google Doc.\
